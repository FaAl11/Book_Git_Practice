I am now adding a new file diretly to the remote repository.

To check if the remote has any changes that my local repository, I will then FETCH IT on intelliJ

○ Fetch will bring the new data without merging to the local project

To update my local repository with the new added file, from the remote I will pull it

○ Pulling is more flexible with branches, and allows fetching and merging at the
same time. We will talk about branches next class

● Updating will apply changes to the same branch
